# Embedded-System-Dehydrator
Used an Arduino with Electrical Engineering and math to create a high quality bulk dehydrator from essentially scratch. 
Repository includes design sheets, code, construction steps, revisions, etc.

This Project was inspired by my passion for coding, embedded systems are an enjoyable hobby of mine.
